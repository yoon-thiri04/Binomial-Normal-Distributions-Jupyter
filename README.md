# Distributions Calculation and Visualization with Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to calculate, visualize, and combine binomial and normal distributions using Python. 
The examples are structured into two main folders: `Binomial Distribution` for binomial distributions and `Gaussian(Normal) Distribution` for normal distributions.
